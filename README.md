# About me
I'm Di Yuan, a postdoc researcher at Gies College of Business  I obtained my PhD in Information Systems at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh.

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI, algorithm, and economics. My current projects use analytical modeling to investigate economic issues arising from AI adoption, including:

- Fairness issues with online advertising platforms

- Impact of AI adoption on pay-for-performance schemes
